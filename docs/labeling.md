# Labeling

Prow github actions expects the file `.prowlabels.yaml` to be in the root of the project.
This is needed for most labeling commands and jobs.
All of the following examples can be placed simultaneously in the `.prowlabels.yaml` file.

## Area labels

```yaml
area:
  - 'bug'
  - 'important'
```

With the command `/area bug`,
the issue or PR will be labeled with `area/bug`

## Kind labels

```yaml
kind:
  - 'failing-test'
  - 'cleanup'
```

With the command `/kind cleanup`,
the issue or PR will be labeled with `kind/cleanup`

## Priority labels

```yaml
priority:
  - 'low'
  - 'high'
```

With the command `/priority low`,
the issue or PR will be labeled with `priority/low`

## Automatic PR labels

To automatically label PRs based on file globs, it's recommended to use the
[GitHub `actions/labeler`](https://github.com/actions/labeler/blob/main/README.md) workflow.
The [Digital Ocean Glob Tool](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tools/glob)
can be helpful when specifying and building file globs.
