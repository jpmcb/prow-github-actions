## OWNERS

A simplified version of [Prow's OWNERS](https://go.k8s.io/owners) file is supported. When an OWNERS file is present at the root of the repository, it is used to authorize the /lgtm and /approve commands. See an [example][owners-example] using an OWNERS file.

The `reviewers` role grants access to the /lgtm command and the approvers role grants access to the /approve command.

The `approvers` role does not grant the reviewers role, a user must be in both roles to use /lgtm and /approve.

The OWNERS file must be in YAML format. All entries are expected to be GitHub usernames; teams are not supported.

```yaml
# List of usernames who may use /lgtm
reviewers:
- user1
- user2
- user3

# List of usernames who may use /approve
approvers:
- user1
- user2
- admin1
```
